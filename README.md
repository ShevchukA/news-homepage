## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)




## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

- Margin top and bottom doesn't work with inline elements -> need to be changed to 'block' types.
- Align-content works with multiple rows, align-items works with single line.
- 

### Continued development

Need to dive deeply to the CCS styling.

### Useful resources
